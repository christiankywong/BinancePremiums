### Tutorial

In this example (purely educational), we show how one might take advantage of a positive funding rate for DOGEUSD_PERP.

1. Register for a Binance account â€“ using my [referral link](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=BN5UXJ7P) gives you 5% off fees.
2. Deposit cash/crypto and buy DOGE spot.
3. Transfer this DOGE into your COIN-M Futures wallet.
4. Select the DOGEUSD perpetual contract (COIN-M -> Delivery).
5. **IMPORTANT**: change the margin mode from "Cross" to "Isolated" and **adjust leverage to 1x**
6. In the "Place Order" window, place a limit order to **Sell/Short** 100%.

Having put this position on, you will receive the funding rate every 8 hours.

<span style="color: red">**Warning:**</span> the funding rate can vary significantly. If you put on the above trade when the funding positive, but later on the funding becomes negative, you will be _paying_ to put the position on. To profit in this scenario, you would have to go short spot and long the future.
