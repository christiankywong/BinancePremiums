# Perpetual futures contracts

Binance also offers **perpetual futures contracts**. Unlike standard futures, these do not have a delivery date.

Instead, the economic link between the future and underlying is a result of **funding**.

-   If the futures price is **above** the index price, the exchange makes the **longs pay funding to the shorts**.
-   If the futures price is **below** the index price, the exchange makes the **shorts pay funding to the longs**.

On Binance, this funding occurs once every 8 hours. Real-time funding rates can be found [here](https://www.binance.com/en/futures/funding-history/quarterly/0).

The table below shows the **average annualised funding rates** for different **perpetual futures contracts** on Binance.
