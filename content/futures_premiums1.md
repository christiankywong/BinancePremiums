# Cash-and-Carry premia

Crypto futures curves are generally in contango, meaning that the futures contracts trade at a premium to spot.

At the time of delivery, the futures price must converge to the spot price, otherwise there would be arbitrage. It is possible to profit from this convergence with a [Cash-and-Carry](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashandcarry.asp) trade, which involves going long spot and short the future. Such a trade is **delta-neutral**, since movements in the futures contract should be offset by movements in the spot market.

The table below shows the **annualised percentage premiums** for different **futures contracts** offered on Binance.
