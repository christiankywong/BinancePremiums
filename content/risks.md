# Risks and considerations

There are several risks to think about before putting on these types of trades:

-   Exchange risk - if the exchange or your account gets hacked, who knows what will happen to the futures contracts.
-   Liquidation risk - possible that if a future gaps up and spot doesn't move you will get liquidated. This is very unlikely, but crazy things happens in the crypto markets.
-   Implementation risk - when putting on these trades, I have accidentally used 20x leverage instead of 1x (Binance puts 20x at the default). If I hadn't immediately realised this, I could have lost my entire margin balance on an up-move (another reason why isolated margin is important).
-   Annualising can often be deceptive. There is no guarantee that this premium will exist in 6 months when your trade expires.
-   The data shown here does not account for fees, spread, or slippage. These matter especially if you are trading in and out of perpetuals hoping to constantly roll to the best yielding perp.
